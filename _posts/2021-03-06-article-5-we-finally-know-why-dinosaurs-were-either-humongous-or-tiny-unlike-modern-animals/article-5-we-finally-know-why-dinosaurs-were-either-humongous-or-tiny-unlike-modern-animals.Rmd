## III - ANALYSIS TABLE ABOUT THE STUDY

* **Researchers?**
    + Katlin Schroeder
    + S. Kathleen Lyons
    + Felisa A. Smith


* **Published in?**
    + Feb 26, 2021


* **General topic**
    + The impact of young megatheropods on the amont of middle-sized carnivorous dinosaurs

* **Procedure/what was examined**
    + Application of a statistical analysis on the recorded fossils of carnivorous dinosaurs all around the world to compare their body size distribution to the one of the present predators

* **Conclusions/discovery**
    + Although the size of dinosaurs drastically increased between the Jurassic and the Cretaceous period, the gap between small and big carnivores was constant
    + Young megatheropods seemed to have played the role of middle-sized carnivores, leaving no available niche for middle-sized carnivores to thrive in
    + The conclusions above seem to apply to all continents

* **Remaining questions**
    + None
