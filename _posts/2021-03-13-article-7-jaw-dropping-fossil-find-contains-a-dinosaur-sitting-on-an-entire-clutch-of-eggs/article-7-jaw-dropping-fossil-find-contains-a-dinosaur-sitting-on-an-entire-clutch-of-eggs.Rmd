* **General topic**
    + The discovery of a very complete fossil of a nest of oviraptorid, containing multiple eggs with embryos and the adult specimen on it

* **Procedure/what was examined**
    + Specimen LDNHMF2008: it is an incomplete fossil of an oviraptorid, guarding at least 24 eggs, some of which containing embryonic bones
        - histological analysis of the bones, using a polarized light microscope
        - phylogenetic analysis based on two different dataset from other studies
        - isotopic analysis of the embroynic bones, analysing their oxygen insotope composition with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer

* **Conclusions/discovery**

    + The individual on top of the eggs was an adult, probably a male. If it is the case, it would prove that oviraptoridae had paternal care
    + The specimen was an oviraptoridae
    + The incubation temperature of the eggs was between 30°C for the lower eggs and 38°C for the upper eggs
    + Since some eggs were close to hatching, this kind of oviraptoridae was protecting its eggs until they hatched
    + The eggs probably would not have hatched at the same time, which was possibly the case for most non-avialan theropods
    
* **Remaining questions**
    + It is not excluded that the specimen on top of the eggs was a female
    + Although the eggs would not have hatched at the same time, it is possible that it was due to an unknown problem and thus was not the general rule
