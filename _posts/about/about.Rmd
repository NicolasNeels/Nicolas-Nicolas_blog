**Who am I?**
My name is Nicolas Neels. I am currently studying biology at the UMons university.

**Why did I make a blog?**
This blog in a long-term project that will be evaluated by M. Grosjean, M Conotte or M. Engels, which are my teachers for the Data Science course, a second year course.

It also will be used for the English course, led by Mrs Van Lancker. I will post articles that will answear all the report criteria of that course.
