* **General topic**
    + Flight abilities of scansoriopterygidae

* **Procedure/what was examined**
    + Testing the flight potential of “membrane-winged” scansoriopterygian dinosaurs using laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging

* **Conclusions/discovery**
    + The studied dinosaurs (Scansoriopterygidae):
        - were probably arboreal
        - probably didn't have access to powered flight
        - had limited gliding abilities
        - are not the base for the way modern birds fly
        - had different wings compared to their contemporaneous paravians, which supports the thesis of various independent origins of flight

* **Remaining questions**
    + None
