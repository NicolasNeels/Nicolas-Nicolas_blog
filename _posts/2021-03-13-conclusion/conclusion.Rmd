Making this portfolio truly was an interesting experience. Indeed, it is the first time I have to read and analyse scientific studies (which are the source of the analysed articles). It was a lot of work and I am sure it will be useful since it allowed me to learn the way scientific studies are led and reported. Moreover, I liked it a lot since it allowed me to discover a lot of things I was not even suspecting. I mean, who would have thought that baby Titanosaurs had nose horns? Or that dinosaurs, who lived more than a hundred million years from us, could develop a form of cancer that is still affecting us today? I honestly was amazed by what I discovered, but thatâ€™s not all: the fact that we had to put it on a blog makes me proud of it. We had to program and customize our whole blog and I firmly believe that it is a good thing because I like programming and it made us more familiar with the R language
