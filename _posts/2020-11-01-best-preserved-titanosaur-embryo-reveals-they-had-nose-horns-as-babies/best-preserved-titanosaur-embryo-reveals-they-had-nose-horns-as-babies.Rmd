* **General topic**
    + Dinosaurs

* **Procedure/what was examined**
    + Analysis of a well-preserved embryonic skull of a titanosaur

* **Conclusions/discovery**
    + The studied fossil:
        - had "advanced ossifications of the snout", highly suggesting the presence of a horn for young titanosaurs
        - used the calcium from their egg-shell very early in their embryonic development 
        - has orbits that face anterolaterally, presumably granting the juveniles binocular vision
    + The horn could have been used for defense and in order to pierce effectively the eggshell when they hatched

* **Remaining questions**
    + None
