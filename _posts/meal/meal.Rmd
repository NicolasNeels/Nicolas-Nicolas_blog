- September 2020 : I downloaded the 'BBC News' and the 'wordreference' Apps on my phone. I don't use the BBC app actively but i enjoy receiving notifications that inform me about important topics

- Oct. 24th : I realised we had a M.E.A.L. page on our blog so I felt pretty blind and tried to think of what I did in English. It isn't very easy since I do a lot of things in English. Playing video-games or watching online videos (e.g. : on Youtube) requires to use English a lot. When I watch series (e.g. :Game of Thrones), I do it in English with English subtitles.

- Oct. 24th : My very first article is finished and posted on my blog. I'm starting to feel comfortable with how RStudio works. This is always a good thing!

- Oct. 25th : My blog now has a green-blue theme. I like it a lot but i wonder if people would like it. Next week disqs should be online on my blog so you will be able to tell me if you guys like it or not. Please consider doing it when it will be possible so i can improve my very first blog!
