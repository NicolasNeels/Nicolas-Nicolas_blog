    + Thomas Beevor

* **Published in?**
    + January 2021


* **General topic**
    + The discovery of fossilized *Spinosaurus aegyptiacus* teeth in the fluvial Kem Kem group strata (Morocco) allows further speculations on its lifestyle

* **Procedure/what was examined**
    + Fossils of diverse prehistoric animals found in the fluvial Kem Kem group strata
        - around 45% of the dental remains (more than 300) are from *Spinosaurus* species, depending on the site
        - It represents between 16.4% and 32.3% of the total vertebrate fossils from the sites, depending on the site
    + Comparison with modern-day crocodilians

* **Conclusions/discovery**

    + Large theropods had probably a constant and relatively fast tooth replacement
    + It is highly probable that *Spinosaurus sp.* lived in river or at least along its banks

* **Remaining questions**
    + None
